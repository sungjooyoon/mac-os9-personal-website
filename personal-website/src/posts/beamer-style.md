# Creating a Beamer-Style Website

Beamer is a LaTeX class for creating presentations that's popular in academic circles, especially for technical and scientific presentations. It has a distinctive style that many academics are familiar with.

## Key Elements of Beamer Style

1. **Clean, structured layout** - Beamer presentations typically have a navigation sidebar or header
2. **Section/subsection hierarchy** - Clear organization of content
3. **Blue and white color scheme** - The default Beamer theme uses these colors
4. **Simple, elegant typography** - Sans-serif fonts and clear hierarchy

## Adapting for the Web

When creating a Beamer-style website, we can adapt these elements:

- Use a sidebar or header navigation
- Maintain the blue/white color scheme
- Employ a clean, academic aesthetic
- Structure content hierarchically

This website is an example of adapting the Beamer presentation style to a web context.
